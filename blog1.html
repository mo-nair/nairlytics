      <h2 class="info">The Journey Begins: Week of September 1, 2025</h2>
      <p class="info">This week in ISM was, to say the least, eventful. It was the true beginning of my journey in the program, with several projects. These included personal portfolios, résumés, and the preliminary research for our career fields.</p>
      <p class="info">With these blogs, I not only want to highlight the highs, but also the lows in my journey. Thus, I aim in highlighting at least one challenge in every blog.</p>
      <p class="info">This week's challenge was my personal portfolio. Although I had the option to use a website builder such as Wix, I decided to test my limits and create my own website. I went in with limited web development experience, and I had to learn a lot of techniques from scratch to tailor my website to my needs. The main challenge here, however, was making my website available to the public. The website is available through my Replit page, but only when the site is running (and, it doesn't run forever). So, I am putting myself to the test, to find a new way to host the site that will make my work accessible to the public both in and outside of school!</p>
