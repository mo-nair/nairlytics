      <h2 class="info">Back on Track: Week of January 12, 2026</h2>
      <p class="info">After a 2 week hiatus that spanned the joyous holiday season, school has begun and we are back on track with ISM. This week, however, we got thrown into the arena with a major hurdle to cross - creating our ISM poster. This poster would present everything we've done in the first semester of the course - research, interviews, our new mentor, and most importantly, our original work. While I had an idea on what to include on the poster, the real challenge was deciding how it would look.</p>
      <p class="info">After discussions with peers, my teacher, and some online research, I decided to go for a technological black and blue aesthethic that really emphasized trust, professionalism, and reliability. Ultimately, this was the message I hoped to send because my whole mission revolves around forming relationships with clients by helping them aleviate their issues through knowledgable prescriptive analytics.</p>
      <p class="info">Once the poster was completed, we compiled everything that we had done in ISM (all of our assessments, original work, interviews, etc.) into a binder that would serve as our Original Work Portfolio. While the poster did exist, there was only so much room one could have to make the poster look neat and professional. Thus, the binder would serve as a detailed look into our semester.</p>
      <p class="info">With this poster and portfolio, we are conducting gallery walks next week during class and an ISM Original Work showcase the week after. I am excited to show my hard work from the first semester of ISM and introduce everyone to the world of Prescriptive Data Analytics!</p>
