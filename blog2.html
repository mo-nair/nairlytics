      <h2 class="info">Ideas Collide at the ISM Business Symposium: Week of September 22, 2025</h2>
      <p class="info">When many think of ISM, they think of creating projects and showcasing knowledge. But all of that knowledge comes from shared ideas, both learned and taught, with peers and professionals. This week gave me a golden opportunity to take advantage of that concept - the ISM Business Symposium.</p>
      <p class="info">The ISM Business Symposium is an annual event during which ISM students network with professionals and students, learn about careers and the ISM program, and attend interviews with professionals. At the program, I learned so many new ideas that it'll take up pages to write all of them down here, so I'll highlight a few of my biggest revelations.</p>
      <p class="info">The biggest positive takeaway from the event was by far the interviews. Both of my interviewers were extremely nice and their benevolence allowed me to divert the interview from more of a Q&A to a casual conversation. The best part is, they both had some sort of connection to my field, whether it was through a career they were in themselves or through another contact. I was able to learn so much about Data Analytics and career advice in general and I hope to build some of my research upon the knowledge I gained.</p>
      <p class="info">Although the event was significantly beneficial to my experience, there were some challenges. A major challenge I faced at ISM were the networking sessions - there were so many people and it was an experience that I never took part in before. Many of the professionals and students that were around me I had no connection to, and so finding and connecting with others was a challenge that even I, a confident, outgoing individual faced. However, as I began to meet new people, I realized that this experience is all a part of the process of growth, and that it will only lead me to be even more confident in my skils. I made many new connections that I am keeping in touch with currently to develop a stronger relationship with these new individuals.</p>
      <p class="info">Overall, ISM Business Symposium was a life changing experience filled with panels, making connections, and understanding more about my career and the program. I hope to further apply the knowledge gained from this experience to my research, as well as future endeavors I may undertake, whether they be in ISM or beyond.</p>
