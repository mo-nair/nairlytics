    <h1 class="info">Hello!</h1>
    <p class="info">My name is Mohit Nair. I am a junior attending Lone Star High School in Frisco, TX. You may see me around campus in Theatre, Debate, Choir, or in DECA! I love getting involved in the community and making new connections that not only let me foster my personal growth but also create valuable experiences for those around me. Outside of school, I watch a lot of movies, play the piano, volunteer around the community, and play video games.</p>
    <p class="info">In the ISM program this year, I will be studying Data Analytics with a concentration in Prescriptive Analytics. From childhood, I have been interested in coding and computer science. Fairly recently, however, I have discovered an innate interest in statistics, and analyzing charts, graphs and information. Because of this I hope to gain a deep understanding in Data Analytics and how we can use data to understand a business’ actions. Moreover, I chose to concentrate on Prescriptive Analytics because in this subfield, specialists take the data that is collected and analyze it to create solutions and provide options for further steps to their clients. This allows me to not only explore my interest in Statistics and Data, but to also help others with information and data that may be advanced or confounding to understand.</p>
