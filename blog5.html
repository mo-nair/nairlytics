      <h2 class="info">Inventions and Insight: Week of November 3, 2025</h2>
      <p class="info">At this time in ISM, we are at a rather important checkpoint. While in the middle of our research, we conducted informational interviews that help us understand professionals' expertise in the field and how challenges can be navigated. My interview this past week was very resourceful, as we talked about how to collect and clean data, how to understand what is needed of our data based on our tasks, and the implications of AI.</p>
      <p class="info">Overall, the interview was highly beneficial to starting exploring my original work. I was able to understand how I can get data, both quantitative and qualitative. When I asked my interviewee about how to begin, he suggested looking into articles and datasets to analyze data. I began this process with articles because I was in the middle of doing my OW Research Assessments at the same time, and ended up finding an article that really dove into issues with personal financial literacy. This prompted a major idea for my OW.</p>
      <p class="info">My idea was to create an app that helped individuals manage financial goals and concerns. Although I had a thorough idea, I would need to figure out how to implement it. Thus, I need to further conduct research and interviews that will apply to developing this project!</p>
