      <h2 class="info">Authenticity: Week of September 29, 2025</h2>
      <p class="info">This week in ISM, we started brainstorming. Not just for our careers, however. We started brainstorming for our original work. The ISM Original Work is an authentic, personalized product that you create that showcases your skills and the knowledge you gained in the program.</p>
      <p class="info">When I attended the ISM Symposium we got introduced to this concept, learning about the different types of projects we could do and examples from ISM II students and alumni. In class last week, we were given the opportunity to think of ways that we could present our knowledge through the original work. We also reflected upon others' ideas and gave them feedback to improve.</p>
      <p class="info">I faced several challenges with this activity. For starters, there were so many options that I could choose from - an app, research paper, pamphlet, presentation, etc. It was difficult to understand the few best projects. However, I was able to utilize my preliminary research to understand the biggest issues to solve and think of the necessary projects. My challenge now is to use my continued research and interviews to finalize my original work, and get started!</p>
