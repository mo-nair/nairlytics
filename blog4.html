      <h2 class="info">Mohit Nair Presents...: Week of October 20, 2025</h2>
      <p class="info">This week in ISM, we presented many, many things - the first of which was our research presentations. This first presentation had us cover our research and journey in ISM so far, as well as what we plan to do next. At first, this challenge seemed very intimidating as we had to present a memorized speech that lasted 5-7 minutes.</p>
      <p class="info">However, I was able to overcome this challenge by breaking up my presentation into smaller parts. I utilized the presentation graphics and visuals to the fullest so I could understand what I needed to talk about when I moved on to the next slide. Finally, I practiced my presentation several times by myself and with others so I could understand my timing and what I needed to improve upon.</p>
      <p class="info">With this presentation, we also presented what we had planned next. For me, this meant starting my original work. While at first I was unable to determine what I would do for my original work, preparing for this presentation and reflecting upon my ISM journey thus far really helped me understand my interests and passions, as well as what I would really excel in. This led me to determine that my original work would be a prototype of an application that uses prescriptive analytics to help users achieve goals and alleviate concerns in personal and corporate finance.</p>
